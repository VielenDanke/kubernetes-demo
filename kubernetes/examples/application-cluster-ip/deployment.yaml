# Let's say you use ReplicaSet-A for controlling your pods, then You wish to update your pods to a newer version,
# now you should create Replicaset-B, scale down ReplicaSet-A and scale up ReplicaSet-B by one step repeatedly (This process is known as rolling update).
# Although this does the job, but it's not a good practice, it's better to let K8S do the job.
#
# A Deployment resource does this automatically without any human interaction and increases the abstraction by one level.
#
# Note: Deployment doesn't interact with pods directly, it is rolling update using ReplicaSets.
